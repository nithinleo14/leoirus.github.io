                    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                    <p>I'm Nithin A N. I'm a full stack developer based in Chennai on the southâ€“eastern coast of India.
                    </p>

                    <p> For me the term full-stack developer is like being the jack of all trades.
                        I am a self learnt developer covering MEAN stack (Mongo, Express.js, Angular, Node.js)covering
                        both frontend and backend.
                        I love to learn the new upcoming technologies.</p>

                    <p>I love designing, drawing, painting since childhood.
                        Later grew my intersets in working with the computers.
                        I like creating new things entirely from scratch more than perfecting things created by others.
                    </p>

                    <p>I found my interest in web development through web designing.
                        At first it was all about the appearances but later I liked the idea of developing awesome
                        things with codes which appears to the non-coders like just numbers, letters and symbols.
                        But for me those numbers, letters and symbols are the building blocks of what I just built in my
                        mind.</p>
                    <p>That's pretty much it,.</p>
